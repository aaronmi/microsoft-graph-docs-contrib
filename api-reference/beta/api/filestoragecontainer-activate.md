# fileStorageContainer: activate


Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Activate a [fileStorageContainer](../resources/filestoragecontainer.md) object.

A **fileStorageContainer** object is created in an inactive state, as indicated by the **status** property. A container must be activated within 24 hours after creation, or it is automatically deleted. Upon activation, the value of the status property changes from `inactive` to `active`.

A **fileStorageContainer** can be activated by calling the activate API or any API that updates or modifies the **fileStorageContainer** or its content. For example, uploading a file to a **fileStorageContainer**, adding permission to a **fileStorageContainer**, creating a custom property on a **fileStorageContainer**, or updating the properties of a **fileStorageContainer** can activate it.


## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
The application that calls this API must have write permissions to a fileStorageContainer for the respective container type.


|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account)|FileStorageContainer.Selected|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not supported.|
|Application|FileStorageContainer.Selected|
